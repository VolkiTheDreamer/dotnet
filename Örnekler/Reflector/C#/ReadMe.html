<p>The sample illustrates using <strong>System.Reflection</strong> to 
run queries over components from <b>System.Xml.Linq.</b> The by-product 
is an HTML document outlining the public APIs for a given assembly, 
in this case <strong>System.Xml.Linq.dll</strong>.</p>

<p>You can easily modify this sample to output the public APIs for any assembly.</p>

<p>In the Program.cs file, replace the type <strong>XDocument</strong> in the following line of code (line 20):
<pre>	XDocument attr = new XDocument();</pre>
with a type from the target assembly.  For example:
<pre>	Reflector attr = new Reflector();</pre></p>

<p>Make sure the assembly is referenced by the project and that the type's namespace is in scope with an appropriate <strong>using</strong> directive.</p>

<p>Many of the LINQ samples require XML files and/or the version of the 
Northwind sample database that is located in the Data sample. If you 
install the Data sample under the same parent folder as the other LINQ 
samples, then the path for the XML files and database file will be 
resolved automatically. Many of the sample files also require the 
ObjectDumper project.</p>
