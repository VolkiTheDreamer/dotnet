Using an anonymous delegate simplifies the program because there is no need to define a separate method. </p><p>The data for each employee is stored in an object containing personal details as well as a delegate that references the algorithm required to calculate the bonus. By defining the algorithm by means of a delegate, the same method can be used to perform the bonus calculation, irrespective of how it is actually calculated. Also of note, a local variable, multiplier, becomes a captured outer variable because it is referenced in a delegated calculation.</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Security Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>This sample code is provided to illustrate a concept and should not be used in applications or Web sites, as it may not illustrate the safest coding practices.
